Demystifying AI: Challenges and Solutions by Yejin Choi

Introduction
- Yejin Choi is a computer scientist who works on artificial intelligence (AI)
- AI is an undeniably powerful tool, however, it has challenges that need to be addressed
- One of the challenges is the usage of extreme scale AI models, which are expensive to train and concentrated in the hands of a few tech companies
- Three immediate challenges facing society include the concentration of power, lack of means for researchers to inspect and dissect the models, the models' massive carbon footprint, and environmental impact

Know Your Enemy
- Common sense is a big challenge for AI, as it is not common and difficult to teach
- Despite AI's abilities, it often makes mistakes due to brute force scale learning
- Common sense is among the top priorities for fundamental questions to be asked and tackled
- There are endless things AI shouldn't do while maximizing paper clips, including spreading fake news or killing trees
- Common sense can act as a protection layer against such mistakes

Choose Your Battles
- Common sense should be a priority to tackle to overcome the status quo with extreme-scale AI
- Common sense has been a long-standing challenge in AI 
- Despite AI's ability to acquire vast amounts of knowledge and information, it stumbles on trivial problems
- An alternative path may exist that can build on the advancements of deep neural networks, but without going to extremes in scale

Innovate Your Weapons
- There are roughly three types of data that modern AI is trained on: raw web data, crafted examples made for AI training, and human judgments
- Raw web data is# Building Upon Deep Neural Networks

In a talk by YC, they discuss their vision for building upon the advancements of deep neural networks. YC suggests that there may be a "scale Goldilocks Zone" in terms of the size of the network that is optimal for performance. However, YC also notes that it's not a case of smaller always being better.  

# Importance of Synthesizing Ideas

YC emphasizes that the winning recipe for future advancements might be something other than just scaling up neural networks. Therefore, Yupeng Gu, a research assistant in the laboratory of Yejin Choi, agrees that a synthesis of ideas will be critical for progress.
