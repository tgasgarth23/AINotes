Sorting Networks for Small Arrays

## Introduction
In today's class, we will be discussing sorting networks, which is one of the instructor's favorite topics in this class.

## Announcements
- Students will have weekly check-in assignments to upload their progress on the sorting and primes assignment. Submission links will be available and leaderboard will be updated before Sunday.
- The deadline for final projects may be pushed back, so students are encouraged to enjoy the nice weather for an hour before it gets colder and wetter over the weekend.

## Sorting Small Arrays
Sorting algorithms are often measured in terms of their asymptotic efficiency, but frequently performed tasks should also be efficient regardless of input size. Insertion sort is an elementary sorting algorithm that only modifies adjacent elements and has a predictable memory access pattern. In the context of small arrays, insertion sort is faster than merge sort and quicksort.

## Comparator Operation
A comparator is a gadget that compares two values and swaps them if they are out of order. It is represented by a vertical line with dots connecting two horizontal lines, which represent the values being compared. As an example, if three is on top and two is at the bottom, the comparator will swap their positions.

## Insertion Sort and Sorting Networks
Insertion sort can be visualized as a sequence of comparator operations, where each iteration corresponds to one operation. Comparators that depend on each other share a lane or have a path from an output of one to an input of another, whereas logically independent comparators have no such paths. Comparators that are logically independent can be performed in parallel, reducing sequential operations to parallel operations with multiple tasks.

## Depth
The depth of a sorting network is defined as the number of steps required to sort an array. By separating comparators into columns based on their dependencies or independence, the depth of the sorting network can be reduced to perform multiple tasks in parallel.Sorting Networks: Theory and Implementation

Summary:
This text explains sorting networks, which are used to sort data in parallel. The length of the longest path from input to output determines the length of the sorting network. The length is the number of comparators crossed or touched. Depth is equal to the minimum number of parallel steps in applying the network. Insertion sort and bubble sort can be parallelized, and when they are parallelized, they use the same procedure. Parallelizing them yields better results in terms of efficiency. The best sorting network for four elements is compared to insertion sort. The text also explains how shuffling works, which is used to swap values in lanes in vectors. 

Longest Path:
The length of the sorting network equals the length of the longest path from input to output, which is from the left side to the right side. The length is the number of comparators that are crossed or touched.

Depth:
Depth equals the minimum number of parallel steps in applying the network.

Insertion Sort and Bubble Sort:
Insertion sort and bubble sort are elementary sorting algorithms for sorting data in parallel. When they are parallelized, they use the same procedure. Parallelization yields better efficiency. 

Sorting Network for Four Elements:
The best sorting network for four elements obtains its optimized parallelization by first comparing the first two values making a comparison in the middle and comparing the last two values. The depth of the sorting network equals three independent steps.

Implementation:
Shuffling is used to swap values in lanes in vectors. Java provides a tool called a vector shuffle to accomplish this.Optimizing Sorting Networks with Vector Operations
---

Introduction and Problem Statement
---
- When sorting arrays, the swap operation causes cache misses and branching overhead.
- Vector operations can address these issues by swapping multiple elements at a time.
- However, using a swap comparator doesn't result in swapping all the elements in the vector.

Sorting Algorithm Implementation with Vector Operations
---
- First, start by defining the shuffle to swap the desired elements.
- Then, create a shuffled version of the vector and compare the values.
- For each blue lane, take the minimum value of the two vectors, and for each pink lane, take the maximum value of the two vectors.
- Use a blend function to update the minimum and maximum vector with the swapped values.
- The optimal sorting network of size eight can be implemented in six layers of vector operations with corresponding shuffles and masks.

Execution Time Comparison
---
- Sorting with insertion sort took 1.5 seconds, while sorting with the network executing all the code took half a second.
- The use of vector operations resulted in three times faster sorting than purely sequential sorting.
- Further parallelization is possible with a bulk of operations.

Conclusion and Authorâ€™s Note
---
- Vector operations can improve the efficiency of sorting algorithms by reducing cache misses and overhead.
- The optimal sorting network of size eight can be implemented with vector operations and masks.
- The code is available for download and experimentation.
