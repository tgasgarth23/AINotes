[Music]
3:43
to me
4:00
foreign [Music]
4:51
and on this basis of sovereignty fraternity friendship and cooperation with all other republics and with uh
4:58
countries abroad along this idea all political forces in ukraine are coming together and this is
5:05
the only thing that can guarantee stability so people uh in this room and outside of
5:12
this room representative of all ethnic groups who live in ukraine they feel
5:17
that the land of ukraine is the motherland and the water
5:29
so now here is the president of united states mr george bush
5:41
[Applause]
5:48
well first thank all of you for that warm welcome
5:53

6:02
that gave us such a warm welcome such a heartfelt greeting
6:08
every american in that long motorcade and believe me it was long
6:15
was moved and touched by the warmth of the welcome
6:21
of the people of ukraine we'll never forget it
6:26
chairman kopchuk thank you sir and to the deputies of the supreme soviet may i salute you
6:34

6:51
very very happy we have only one regret and that is that
6:57
i've got to get home on thursday night i can still make it
7:02
the reason is our congress goes out uh tomorrow finishes their session
7:08
they're in now and i felt it was important to be there on that last day
7:14
of the final session this beautiful city
7:21
brings to mind the words of the poet alexander dotenko
7:28
the city of kiev is an orchard kiev is a poet kiev is an epic
7:35
key of his history he have his art centuries ago
7:42
your forebears name this country ukraine or frontier
7:47
because your steps link europe and asia but ukrainians have become frontiersmen
7:53
of another sort today you explore the frontiers and contours of liberty
8:03
though my stay here as i said is far too short i've come here to talk with you and to
8:08
learn and for those who love freedom every experiment in building an open
8:14
society offers new lessons and insights you
8:21
face an especially daunting task for years people in this nation
8:27
felt powerless overshadowed by a vast government apparatus
8:36
cramped by forces that attempted to control every aspect of their lives
8:43
and today your people probe the promise of freedom
8:48
in cities and republics on farms
8:53
in businesses around university campuses you debate the fundamental question
9:01
of liberty self-rule and free enterprise
9:07
americans you see have a deep commitment to these values
9:14
we follow your your progress with a sense of fascination
9:19
excitement and hope and this alone is historic
9:26
in the past our nations engaged in duels of eloquent bluff and
9:31
bravado and now the fireworks of superpower confrontation
9:38
are giving way to the quieter and far more hopeful arts
9:43
of cooperation i come here to tell you we support the
9:49
struggle in this great country for democracy and economic reform
9:55
and i would like to talk to you today about how the united states
10:01
views this complex and exciting period in your history how we intend to relate to the soviet
10:07
central government and the republican governments
10:12
in moscow i outlined our approach we will support those in the center and
10:18
the republics who pursue freedom democracy
10:24
and economic liberty we will discern determine our support
10:30
not on the basis of personalities but on the basis of principles
10:37
and we cannot tell you how to reform your society we will not try to pick winners and
10:44
losers and political competition between republics or between republics in the center
10:50
that is your business that's not the business of the united states of america
10:57
do not doubt our real commitment however to reform do not think we can presume to solve
11:04
your problems for you theodore roosevelt one of our great presidents
11:10
once wrote to be patronized
11:15
is as offensive [Music] as to be insulted
11:22
no one of us cares permanently to have someone else conscientiously striving to do him good
11:31
what we want to work with that's someone else
11:36
for the good of both of us that's what our former president said
11:42
we will work for the good of both of us which means that we will not meddle in
11:47
your internal affairs some people have urged the united states
11:53
to [Music] choose between supporting president gorbachev and supporting independence-minded
12:00
leaders throughout the ussr i consider this a false choice
12:08
in fairness president gorbachev has achieved astonishing things and his policies of
12:14
glasnost and perestroikan democratization point toward the goals of freedom democracy and economic
12:22
liberty we will maintain the strongest possible relationship with the soviet government
12:29
of president gorbachev but we also appreciate the new realities of life
12:35
in the ussr and therefore as a federation ourselves
12:44
we want good relations improved relations
12:50
with the republics so let me build upon my comments in moscow
12:56
by describing in more detail what americans mean
13:02
when we talk about freedom democracy and economic liberty
13:10
no terms have been abused more regularly nor more cynically
13:16
than these throughout this century despots
13:22
have masqueraded as democrats jailors have posed as liberators
13:29
and we can restore faith in government only by restoring meaning
13:36
to these concepts i don't want to sound like i'm lecturing
13:42
but let's begin with the broad term freedom
13:48
when americans talk of freedom we refer to people's ability to live
13:53
without fear of government intrusion
13:59
without fear of harassment by their fellow citizens without restricting others freedom
14:10
we do not consider freedom a privilege to be doled out only to those who hold
14:17
proper political views or belong to certain groups
14:22
we consider it an inalienable individual right
14:29
bestowed upon all men and women
14:34
lord acton once observed the most certain test
14:40
by which we judge whether a country is really free is the amount of security
14:47
enjoyed by minorities freedom requires tolerance
14:56
a concept embedded in openness in in glasgnose and in our first amendment protections
15:03
for the freedoms of speech association and religion all religions
15:10
tolerance nourishes hope a priest
15:17
a priest wrote of glasnost today more than ever the words of paul
15:22
the apostle spoken two thousand years ago ring out
15:29
they counted us among the dead but look we are alive
15:36
in ukraine in russia in armenia and the baltics the spirit of liberty
15:44
thrives
15:51
but freedom cannot survive if we let despots flourish
15:58
or permit seemingly minor restrictions to multiply
16:04
until they form chains until they form shackles
16:13
later today i'll visit the monument at baby yar a somber reminder
16:20
a solemn reminder of what happens when people fail to hold back the horrible tide of
16:27
intolerance and tyranny
16:32
and yet freedom is not the same as independence [Music]
16:38
americans will not support those who seek independence in order to replace a far-off tyranny with a local
16:46
despotism they will not aid those
16:51
who promote a suicidal nationalism based upon ethnic hatred
17:00
we will support those who want to build democracy
17:06
and by democracy [Music] we mean a system of government
17:13
in which people may vie openly for the hearts and yes the votes
17:20
of the public we mean a system of government that derives its just power
17:27
from the consent of the government that retains its legitimacy
17:33
by controlling its appetite for power
17:39
for years you had elections with with ballots but you did not enjoy democracy
17:46
and now democracy has begun to set firm roots in soviet soil
17:53
the key to its success lies in understanding government's
17:58
proper role and its limits democracy
18:05
is not a technical process driven by dry statistics
18:14
it is the very human enterprise of preserving freedom
18:21
so that we can do the important things the really important things
18:26
raise families explore our own creativity
18:32
build good and fruitful lives
18:38
in modern societies freedom and democracy rely on economic liberty
18:47
the free economy is nothing more than a system of communication
18:54
it simply cannot function without individual rights
18:59
or a profit motive which gives people an incentive to go to work an incentive to produce
19:08
and it certainly cannot function without the rule of law without fair and enforceable contracts
19:17
without laws that protect property rights and punish fraud
19:25
free economies depend upon the freedom of expression the ability of people to exchange ideas
19:31
and test out new theories [Music] the soviet union weakened itself
19:39
for years by restricting the flow of information
19:44
by outlawing devices crucial to modern communications such as computers and copying machines and when you restricted
19:53
free movement even tourist travel you prevented your own people from
19:59
making the most of their talent you cannot innovate
20:04
if you cannot communicate and finally
20:11
a free economy demands engagement in the economic mainstream
20:18
adam smith noted two centuries ago trade enriches all who engage in it
20:26
isolation and protectionism doom its practitioners
20:31
to degradation and want i note this today
20:38
because some soviet cities regions and even republics
20:43
have engaged in in ruinous trade wars the republics of this nation have
20:49
extensive bonds of trade which no one can repeal
20:55
with the stroke of a pen or the passage of a law the vast majority of trade
21:02
conducted by soviet companies imports and exports
21:08
involves as you know better than i trade between republics
21:17
the nine plus one agreement holds forth the hope that republics will combine greater autonomy
21:23
with greater voluntary interaction political
21:28
social cultural economic rather than pursuing
21:35
the hopeless course of isolation
21:41
and so american investors and businessmen look forward to doing business in the
21:47
soviet union including the ukraine we signed agreements this week
21:54
that will encourage further interaction between the us and all levels of the soviet union
22:01
but ultimately our trade relations will depend upon our ability to develop
22:07
a common language a common language of commerce
22:12
currencies that communicate with one another laws that protect innovators and entrepreneurs
22:19
bonds of understanding and trust it should be
22:24
obvious that the ties between our nations grow stronger every single day
22:31
i set forth a presidential initiative that is providing badly needed medical aid to the soviet union
22:38
and this aid expresses american solidarity with the soviet peoples during a time of
22:43
hardship and suffering and it has supplied facilities in kiev
22:49
that are treating victims of chernobyl you should know that america's heart
22:56
the heart of all hearts of all went out to the people here at the time of chernobyl
23:05
we have sent teams to help you improve upon the safety of ukrainian nuclear
23:10
plants and coal mines we've also increased the number of cultural exchanges with the republics
23:17
including more extensive legal academic and cultural exchanges between
23:22
america and ukraine and we understand that you cannot reform your system overnight
23:31
america's first system of government the uh of the continental congress
23:37
failed because the states were too suspicious
23:43
of one another [Music] and the central government too weak
23:48
to protect commerce and individual rights and in 200 years we've learned
23:55
we've learned that freedom democracy and economic liberty are more than terms
24:02
of inspiration they're more than words they are challenges
24:09
your great poet shevchenko noted in your own house
24:15
can you have your truth your strength and freedom
24:22
no society ever achieves perfect democracy liberty or enterprise
24:28
if it makes full use of its people's virtues and abilities it can use these goals as guides
24:36
to a better life and now
24:41
as soviet citizens try to forge a new social compact you have the obligation to restore power
24:48
to citizens demoralized by decades of totalitarian
24:53
rule you've got to give them hope and inspiration
25:00
determination by showing your faith in their abilities
25:09
societies that don't trust themselves or their people cannot provide freedom
25:14
and they can guarantee only the bleak tyranny of suspicion avarice and poverty
25:22
an old ukrainian proverb says when you enter a great enterprise
25:29
free your soul from weakness the peoples of the ussr
25:36
have entered a great enterprise full of courage and vigor and i've come
25:42
here today to say we support those who explore the frontiers of freedom
25:48
we will join these reformers on the path to what we call appropriately call a new
25:54
world order you're the leaders
26:00
you are the participants in the political process
26:06
and i go home to an active political process
26:12
so if you saw me waving like mad from my limousine
26:18
it was in the thought that maybe some of those people along the line were people from uh philadelphia or pittsburgh or detroit
26:26
where so many ukrainian americans live where so many ukrainian americans are
26:32
with me in the remarks i've made here today this has been a great
26:40
experience for barbara and me to be here we salute you we salute the changes that we see
26:48
i remember the french expression viva la difference and i see different churnings around this chamber and that's
26:54
exactly the way it ought to be one guy wants this another one that that's the way the process works when
27:00
you're open and free competing with ideas to see who's going to emerge correct and who can do the
27:07
most for the people in ukraine and so for us
27:12
this has been a wonderful trip albeit far too short and may i simply say
27:18
may god bless the people of ukraine thank you very very much
28:07
[Music]
28:12
i would like to express my gratitude for uh sharing
28:18
your ideas and thoughts with us we believe that
28:24
this is the experience of a great role that you've come
28:29
along the road of democracy and liberty for all of us present here
28:39
it was really very moving to hear that
28:44
in order to persuade everybody that we're striving
28:50
for uh democracy and for progress and you quoted shivchenko our great poet
28:56
and and i would like to say that this is not only a very spiritual moment to us
29:03
but also the sign that you feel deep respect to the history of our land
29:09
and would like to assure you that
29:16
this will give us another yet another impetus to pursue sovereignty
29:24
and your permission i would also like to make a little joke
29:30
in this room we've been working for more than a year
29:38
15 months but they've never been so many people in this room before
29:45
and it's never been that silent when somebody was making a speech
29:56
and i just thought that well it would be great existence for me if
30:02
you come here more often
30:13
foreign
