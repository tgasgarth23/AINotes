The Color Wheel
- The color wheel has primary colors, secondary colors, and tertiary colors.
- Complementary colors are opposite on the color wheel.
- Analogous colors are similar and appear next to each other.

Color Systems
- There are two primary color systems: RGB and CMYK.
- RGB uses light to produce color, while CMYK uses ink to reflect or not reflect light.
- Which system to use depends on the output, and it affects how colors appear.

Broad Color Groups
- Warm colors include red, yellow, and orange and are often linked with happiness and excitement.
- Cool colors include blue, green, and purple and are associated with trust, authority, and stability.
- Neutral colors include gray, brown, black, and white and do not evoke a feeling.

Specific Colors and Their Meanings
- Red is associated with power, passion, and anger.
- Orange represents happiness, joy, and deceit.
- Yellow is the happy color, but it can be associated with caution and jealousy.
- Green signifies nature, healing, and money, but it can also represent greed and jealousy.
- Blue conveys stability, trust, and expertise, but it can also symbolize coldness and depression.
- Purple is regarded as a color of royalty, wealth, and luxury, as well as creativity and spirituality.
- Black represents power, sophistication, and depth, but it can also signify death and the unknown.
- White relates to purity, cleanliness, and safety but can feel cold or distant.

The Importance of Color in Design
- Unconscious judgments are made within 90 seconds of initial viewing, and color, alone, plays a significant role.
- A designer needs to be mindful of color choices and how they affect the viewer's sensory experience.Color Theory and Charlie Harper Illustration

Swatches and Color Theory:
- In Part 1 of the lesson, students are asked to create swatches.
- Color information can be found on Palatin, Colored, and Color Lovers.
- Google search can also be done for more information.

Conclusion:
- Color choice matters in design.
- The way back machine on archive.org/web can be used to see how company websites have changed over time.# Creating Swatches and Referencing Charlie Harper

In this class, the students are instructed to find an image of Charlie Harper to use as a base for their work. They are encouraged to draw on top of it and start creating the composition. A color palette is also suggested, and several websites are shown for identifying color relationships. Paluton is shown as one of the great websites for determining color relationships, as it offers monochromatic, analogous, split complementary, and tetrad color schemes. The students are urged to start working on the Charlie Harper composition as it's due on the Wednesday after Spring Break. They are told to submit their work to canvas. 

## Using Paluton to Identify Color Relationships

Paluton is a website that helps people determine color relationships by offering different color schemes such as monochromatic, analogous, split complementary, and tetrad. The instructor demonstrates how to pick a primary color and obtain its analogous colors. They show the students how to download the swatches and save them for future use. They use Photoshop to demonstrate how to use swatches to pick colors and how to create, load, and export swatches. 

## Other Websites for Obtaining Swatches

The instructor shows another website, Colored, which helps people identify the colors in an image and create color palettes. The website provides previously created palettes that can be downloaded or used as inspiration. The instructor also encourages the students to explore the pre-existing swatches on the digital tools site under resources. There are several zip files available for download which contain different texture swatches. 

## Tips and Tricks For Working With Swatches

The instructor advises the students to get comfortable working with swatches and converting them between Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign. They show how certain swatches can only be used with certain applications and illustrate the architectural swatches which can only be used in Illustrator because they have a texture to them. The instructor emphasizes exploring swatches, creating them, and using them in their work. 

Overall, the class revolves around using an image of Charlie Harper as a base and drawing on top of it while using a color palette to create color harmony. The students are shown different websites and techniques to help them explore and create swatches, which they will need to use in their compositions.
