Crash Course World History: World War II

Introduction 
- John Green is going to talk about World War II 
- Reasonably entertaining, unlike the war 
- The goal: give perspective on how and why the war happened  

When did WWII start?
- Hard to pinpoint one specific starting date 
- Possible start dates: Japan invading Manchuria in 1931 or China in 1937, Hitler taking power in 1933, or America starting to fight in 1941 

The European Theater of World War II 
- Most well-known part of the war 
- Hitler started the war with his re-militarization and eventually going to war 
- New style of combat using mechanized technology called the Blitzkrieg, where the Nazis quickly rolled over central Europe 
- Then, set their sights on Britain, where the Battle of Britain occurred 
- Europeans also fought in North Africa and Americans fought Nazis for the first time there 
- The war in Europe changed when the Nazis invaded Russia, leading to many deaths 
- Eventually, the Allies declared victory in Europe  

1941
- A big year for WWII 
- The Nazis invaded Russia, creating allies between capitalist and communist countries
- The Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, hoping to keep the United States neutral, which failed 
- Japan also invaded Southeast Asia, making Australia and New Zealand nervous 

End of World War II
- Allies advanced from the west and Russian Red Army from the east 
- Last-ditch German offensive at the battle of the Bulge failed 
- Mussolini was executed and Hitler committed suicide 
- World War II ended after Germany surrendered unconditionally 
- Three months later, the United States dropped nuclear bombs and Japan surrendered  

The Hunger Plan 
- WWII had a definite cause – unbridled military expansion by Germany, Japan, and Italy 
- Hitler wanted to expand Germany’s territory by taking Poland, the Ukraine, and Eastern Russia, calling it the Hunger Plan, where they wanted to feed Germany’s citizens by resettling Germans in this new land 
- This plan called for 20 million people to starve to death 
- 6 million Jews were killed by the Nazis 
- Japan also sought to expand its agricultural holdings to feed its population growth 

Importance of World War II
- Proved that man is a wolf to man 
- Many people died, including noncombatants 
- World War II changed how we view warfare and the world as a whole# Modern War and Its Effects on Civilians

During modern wars, civilians are not excluded from attack. This is because the civilians help sustain the war through industrial and agricultural production. In a total war, the line between soldier and civilian blurs resulting in a non-existent non-military target. The bombings of major cities like Dresden, Tokyo, and Hiroshima targeted both civilians and soldiers. The Holocaust also horrified the world as modern industrial powers used technology and record-keeping to exterminate millions of people. The atrocities committed during World War II forced us to question Western dominance of the planet and whether it could be considered progress.
