Title: Virtual Memory

Introduction
- Review of previous chapter on memory management
- Problems with contiguous memory allocation
- Alternative methods: non-contiguous memory allocation techniques
- Introduction of segmentation and paging

Logical and Physical Address Space
- Logical address space is contiguous, but physically scattered
- Physical memory has a subset of logical address space
- Introduction of virtual memory 
- Only load necessary pages with demand paging
- Pure demand paging vs. demand paging with predicted pages
- Advantages of virtual memory

Page Tables and Virtual Address Space
- Virtual address space = logical address space
- Page table maps virtual memory to physical memory
- Dynamic memory allocation with demand paging
- Valid/invalid bit added to page table for detection

Implementation of Virtual Memory
- Swapping at the page level instead of the whole address space
- Valid/invalid bit used to indicate if page is in physical memory
- Example of virtual memory with physical memory and disk

Conclusion
- Virtual memory provides flexibility and efficient resource utilization# Summary: Virtual Memory and Page Faults

Virtual memory allows for programs to access memory that is not physically present through hardware support, which enables page faults. A page fault occurs when a program tries to access a page that is not in physical memory, and control is given to the operating system to load the requested page from disk to memory. However, disk access is slow, so while the operating system handles the page fault, it can give the CPU to other processes. Despite the potential slowness of page fault handling, virtual memory works effectively due to the concept of locality, where nearby pages are often accessed together. This means that while a program may continually reference different pages at different times, it will often refer back to the same pages, which have already been loaded into physical memory. This optimizes performance and prevents programs from being slowed down by frequent page faults. 

### Hardware Support for Virtual Memory
Virtual memory requires hardware support, such as an exception or interrupt, to give control to the operating system when a program references an invalid page.

### Page Faults
A page fault is when a program attempts to access a page that is not in physical memory. The operating system takes control and loads the requested page from disk to memory.

### Slowness of Page Fault Handling
Disk access, which is involved in page fault handling, is much slower than memory access. However, while the operating system handles the page fault, it can give the CPU to other processes.

### Locality of Reference
Locality means that nearby pages are often accessed together and programs will frequently refer back to the same pages, which have already been loaded into physical memory. This optimizes performance and prevents frequent page faults from slowing down programs.
